//! The Eidos hash construction and its underlying compression function.
//!
//! [`Eidos`](crate::hash::eidos::Eidos) exposes a framed hash construction and a raw compression
//! operation. Complete-hash methods apply domain and length binding, framing, and padding.
//! [`Eidos::compress`](crate::hash::eidos::Eidos::compress) compresses one complete block under a
//! caller-supplied chaining value and adds no framing.
//!
//! Eidos digests occupy a 252-bit packed subspace: the high bit of each odd Eidos compression
//! output lane is cleared before two `u32` lanes are packed into one Goldilocks field element. The
//! resulting generic collision-resistance bound is 126 bits.
//!
//! Each digest element is below `2^63`, so digest elements are not uniform over the Goldilocks
//! field and their 32-byte serialization is not a uniform 256-bit string. Use
//! [`crate::rand::EidosRandomCoin::draw_basefield`] for full-field sampling and
//! [`crate::aead::aead_eidos`] for authenticated encryption. The Fiat-Shamir challenger retains
//! the restricted output distribution; its soundness bounds must use the actual sampling support.
//!
//! See the [security and usage guide](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-vm/design/eidos-security).
